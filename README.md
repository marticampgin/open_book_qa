# Open Book Scientific Question Answering ðŸ¤–
In this project, the goal was to create an Open Book QA-system that will specifically be tailored to answer scientific questions.

It is lightweight (compared to generative LLMS) and extracts relevant answers from provided documents. Everything is wrapped in a simple
Streamlit UI for more user-friendly usage. 

### Usage:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
