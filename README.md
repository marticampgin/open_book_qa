# Open Book Scientific Question Answering ðŸ¤–
In this project, the goal was to create an Open Book QA-system that will specifically be tailored to answer scientific questions.

It is lightweight (compared to generative LLMS) and extracts relevant answers from provided documents. Everything is wrapped in a simple
Streamlit UI for more user-friendly usage. 

### Usage:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
### How it is working: 
The dataset used for the project contained scientific questions, contexts, and respective answers (https://huggingface.co/datasets/sciq).

Moreover, I simulated a 'lack of data' by taking out a portion of contexts without their questions. This was done in order to try and
generate more data using gpt-3.5-turbo model from OpenAI, by sending inputs in bulk utilizing Relevance AI (https://relevanceai.com/).
